# Introduction to Shiny

Slides + code for a talk/workshop given to R-Ladies Tunisia on July 4, 2020.

Uses economic data from [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/524575/share-of-economic-sectors-in-the-gdp-in-tunisia/) about Tunisia, which is loaded in the repo in every folder you'll need it to be in.

Note that each step of the app is in a different folder (all numbered at the end with _#.)
